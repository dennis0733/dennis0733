## Featured Project: Wildlife Camera-Trap Species Classification

**Production-ready two-stage pipeline achieving 27.5% cross-domain error reduction**

Developed an automated wildlife monitoring system that addresses the critical domain shift challenge in camera-trap imagery:

- **Stage 1**: MegaDetector v6 for high-recall animal detection
- **Stage 2**: ConvNeXt classifier for 13-species identification
- **Challenge Solved**: Robust performance across unseen camera locations
- **Real Impact**: Automating conservation efforts for wildlife monitoring

[![Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Source_Code-GitHub-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/dennis0733/wildlife-cameratrap)

**Key Results:**
- F1 Score: 0.903 (seen locations) → 0.773 (unseen locations)
- Dataset: 51k+ camera-trap images across 20 locations
- Deployment: ONNX models with interactive web interface
- Validation: Comprehensive cross-domain evaluation framework
